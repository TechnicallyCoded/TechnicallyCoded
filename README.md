# TechnicallyCoded
Software Engineer

## Quick Intro
I am currently an Information Technology and Computer Science college student in the USA. I started my journey in 2016 by writing simple Minecraft server mods. My interest evolved into actively hosting and running multiple networks, some with only a couple hundred registered users, and others with tens of thousands of registered users. Today I primarily offer my years of experience in the field to various projects. Frequently working directly with packet-based features. I am also a quite avid cybersecurity enthusiast stemming primarily from active & live threats encountered in production environments of the game servers I hosted. I enjoy reverse-engineering and analyzing attack vectors used against companies I collaborate with.
